        Ceramic Pro is a multi-layerable, clear, liquid nano-ceramic coating.
        When cured, this technology will transform itself on the surface to a
        permanent, durable yet flexible glass shield. Ceramic Pro can be
        described as an additional clear coat, with 3 times the hardness and
        self cleaning properties.

        Ceramic Pro 9H forms a permanent bond with the surface and will not wash
        off or break down. Ceramic Pro 9H can only be removed by abrasion. It is
        a highly durable protective coating that protects your paintwork from
        damaging contaminants. 9H can be applied in multiple layers which means
        the thickness of the coating can be increased with additional layers
        allowing a thicker/harder coating with improved scratch resistance.

        Top Coat allows the surface to stay cleaner longer as dirt and grime
        will not stick to it. The super hydrophobic effect of the coating will
        cause water to bead up and roll off the surface along with any dirt and
        grime. Top Coat is usually applied over 9H in the layering process.
        Though not as durable as 9H, it can also be applied on its own. Top Coat
        also enhances gloss depth further on all painted surfaces for that wet
        look that is often hard to attain with synthetic waxes.

        Ceramic Pro PPF &amp; Vinyl was designed as a protective coating for
        polyurethane film and vinyl. It protects from contamination and
        weathering resulting in film that is much easier to clean. It also helps
        reduce vinyl’s orange peel look. The complete protection program
        involves a base coat and top coat application.
